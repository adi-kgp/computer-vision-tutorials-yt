This repo contains the code that I wrote while following along the tutor Philip from this channel "https://www.youtube.com/@ComputerVisionEngineer". The idea was to learn computer vision coding while simulataneously watching videos (as I am an intermediate python user and have worked on machine learning projects professionally as well) and later explore theoretical concepts (not included in this repo) that I would encounter while watching the videos. 

The ulitmate goal of this exercise (besides the joy, thrill and curiosity of coding and learning latest technologies), is to prepare myself for job interviews and to show potential recruiters that "I was busy in learning and not wasting time, hence I am a good recruit even though I have gaps in resume and currently unemployed".
